Difference between window, screen, and document in JavaScript :

WINDOW:

The JavaScript window object sits at the top of the JavaScript Object hierarchy and represents the browser window.
 The window object is supported by all browsers. 
All global JavaScript objects , functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object. The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser . 
This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.
The window object represents the current browsing context . It holds things like window.location, window.history, window.screen, window.status, or the window.document .
Each browser tab has its own top-level window object. Each of these windows gets its own separate global object. window.window always refers to window, but window.parent and window.top might refer to enclosing windows, giving access to other execution contexts.
 Moreover, the window property of a window object points to the window object itself.


WINDOW OBJWECTS: It has two properties to determine the size of the browser window. :

window.innerHeight : gives the inner height of the browser window (in pixels)

window.innerWidth : gives the inner width of the browser window (in pixels)



WINDOW METHODS:

Some window object methods are:

window.open() : open a new window

window.close() : close the current window

window.moveTo() : move the current window

window.resizeTo() : resize the current window



DOCUMENT:

The Document object represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web pageâ€™s content, which is the DOM tree. 
When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser , it becomes a document object. 
It is the root node of the HTML document. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.

 HTML ELEMENTS:

HTML elements document object methods,

document.getElementById(id) : Find and return an element by element id

document.getElementsByTagName(name) : Find and return an element by tag name

document.getElementsByClassName(name) : Find return an element by class name

We can change the HTML element contents like style, text, attributes, 

element.innerHTML = new html content : Change the inner HTML of an element

element.attribute = new value : Change the attribute value of an HTML element
